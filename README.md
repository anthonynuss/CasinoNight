A casino suite. Consisting of two casino games, BlackJack and Slots.

BlackJack: Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other.
The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting).
At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each.
The players' cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down (called the hole card) and one face up.
The best possible Blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card.
The house advantage of this game is derived from several rules that favour the dealer.
The most significant of these is that the player must act before the dealer, allowing the player to bust and lose their bet before the dealer plays.


Slot machine: a coin-operated gaming machine that generates random combinations of symbols on a dial,
certain combinations winning varying amounts of money for the player. It has three reels. You can either land on a symbol
or between it. Only lands on a symbol count for a winning variation.
